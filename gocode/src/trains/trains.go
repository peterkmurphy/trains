// The trains program (Go implementation).

// Executed as:
//
// go run trains.go [graphfile.txt]
//
// Where graphfile.txt contains a single line representing a directed graph.
// (The syntax of graphfile.txt is explained below.)
// Without command line arguments, the program does nothing.
//
// Rules as explained:
// The local commuter railroad services a number of towns in Kiwiland.  Because
// of monetary concerns, all of the tracks are 'one-wayâ€™. That is, a route from
// Kaitaia to Invercargill does not imply the existence of a route from
// Invercargill to Kaitaia. In fact, even if both of these routes do happen
// to exist, they are distinct and are not necessarily the same distance!
//
// The purpose of this problem is to help the railroad provide its customers
// with information about the routes. In particular, you will compute the
// distance along a certain route, the number of different routes between
// two towns, and the shortest route between two towns.
//
// Input: A directed graph where a node represents a town and an edge represents
// a route between two towns. The weighting of the edge represents the distance
// between the two towns. A given route will never appear more than once, and
// for a given route, the starting and ending town will not be the same town.
//
// Output: For test input 1 through 5, if no such route exists, output 'NO SUCH
// ROUTE'. Otherwise, follow the route as given; do not make any extra stops!
// For example, the first problem means to start at city A, then travel directly
// to city B (a distance of 5), then directly to city C (a distance of 4).
//
// 1. The distance of the route A-B-C.
// 2. The distance of the route A-D.
// 3. The distance of the route A-D-C.
// 4. The distance of the route A-E-B-C-D.
// 5. The distance of the route A-E-D.
// 6. The number of trips starting at C and ending at C with a maximum of 3
//   stops.  In the sample data below, there are two such trips: C-D-C (2 stops)
//   and C-E-B-C (3 stops).
// 7. The number of trips starting at A and ending at C with exactly 4 stops.
//   In the sample data below, there are three such trips: A to C (via B,C,D); A
//   to C (via D,C,D); and A to C (via D,E,B).
// 8. The length of the shortest route (in terms of distance to travel) from A
//   to C.
// 9. The length of the shortest route (in terms of distance to travel) from B
//   to B.
// 10. The number of different routes from C to C with a distance of less than
//   30. In the sample data, the trips are: CDC, CEBC, CEBCDC, CDCEBC, CDEBC,
//   CEBCEBC, CEBCEBCEBC.
//
// Test Input:
// For the test input, the towns are named using the first few letters of the
// alphabet from A to D. A route between two towns (A to B) with a distance of 5
// is represented as AB5.
//
// Graph: AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7
//
// Expected Output:
// Output #1: 9
// Output #2: 5
// Output #3: 13
// Output #4: 22
// Output #5: NO SUCH ROUTE
// Output #6: 2
// Output #7: 3
// Output #8: 9
// Output #9: 9
// Output #10: 7
