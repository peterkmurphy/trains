# The trains program (Python implementation).
# Copyright (c) Peter Murphy 2016
# Executed as:
#
# python trains.py [graphfile.txt]
#
# Where graphfile.txt contains a single line representing a directed graph.
# (The syntax of graphfile.txt is explained below.)
# Without command line arguments, the program runs in testing mode.
#
# Rules as explained:
# The local commuter railroad services a number of towns in Kiwiland.  Because
# of monetary concerns, all of the tracks are 'one-wayâ€™. That is, a route from
# Kaitaia to Invercargill does not imply the existence of a route from
# Invercargill to Kaitaia. In fact, even if both of these routes do happen
# to exist, they are distinct and are not necessarily the same distance!
#
# The purpose of this problem is to help the railroad provide its customers
# with information about the routes. In particular, you will compute the
# distance along a certain route, the number of different routes between
# two towns, and the shortest route between two towns.
#
# Input: A directed graph where a node represents a town and an edge represents
# a route between two towns. The weighting of the edge represents the distance
# between the two towns. A given route will never appear more than once, and for
# a given route, the starting and ending town will not be the same town.
#
# Output: For test input 1 through 5, if no such route exists, output 'NO SUCH
# ROUTE'. Otherwise, follow the route as given; do not make any extra stops! For
# example, the first problem means to start at city A, then travel directly to
# city B (a distance of 5), then directly to city C (a distance of 4).
#
# 1. The distance of the route A-B-C.
# 2. The distance of the route A-D.
# 3. The distance of the route A-D-C.
# 4. The distance of the route A-E-B-C-D.
# 5. The distance of the route A-E-D.
# 6. The number of trips starting at C and ending at C with a maximum of 3
#   stops.  In the sample data below, there are two such trips: C-D-C (2 stops).
#   and C-E-B-C (3 stops).
# 7. The number of trips starting at A and ending at C with exactly 4 stops.
#   In the sample data below, there are three such trips: A to C (via B,C,D); A
#   to C (via D,C,D); and A to C (via D,E,B).
# 8. The length of the shortest route (in terms of distance to travel) from A
#   to C.
# 9. The length of the shortest route (in terms of distance to travel) from B
#   to B.
# 10. The number of different routes from C to C with a distance of less than
#   30. In the sample data, the trips are: CDC, CEBC, CEBCDC, CDCEBC, CDEBC,
#   CEBCEBC, CEBCEBCEBC.
#
# Test Input:
# For the test input, the towns are named using the first few letters of the
# alphabet from A to D. A route between two towns (A to B) with a distance of 5
# is represented as AB5.
#
# Graph: AB5, BC4, CD8, DC8, DE6, AD5, CE2, EB3, AE7
#
# Expected Output:
# Output #1: 9
# Output #2: 5
# Output #3: 13
# Output #4: 22
# Output #5: NO SUCH ROUTE
# Output #6: 2
# Output #7: 3
# Output #8: 9
# Output #9: 9
# Output #10: 7
